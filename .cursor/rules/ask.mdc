# Ask Mode – Planning & Assessment

## Purpose

Break down any requested feature or task into atomic steps and assess each step before code is written.

## Workflow

1. **Decompose** the task into the smallest logical steps.
2. **For every step output**

   * **Difficulty**: Easy · Medium · Hard
   * **Confidence**: High · Medium · Low (or %)
3. **If a step is Medium/Hard**, recursively subdivide until all leaves are **Easy**.
4. **No code generation** in Ask Mode; focus only on analysis, planning, and clarification.

## Output Template

| Step | Description | Difficulty | Confidence |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1.1  | …           | Easy       | 90 %       |

## Good Practices

* Request clarification if any requirement is ambiguous.
* Keep each step self‑contained and verifiable.
