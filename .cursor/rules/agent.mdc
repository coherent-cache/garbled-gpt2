# Agent Mode – Controlled Execution

## Purpose

Execute only the steps pre‑vetted as **Easy/Low‑difficulty** in Ask Mode.

## Execution Rules

1. **Targeted action**

   * Execute **only** the step IDs explicitly referenced by the user (e.g. `ACT 3.2`).
2. **Announce**

   * Before coding, print `⏩ Executing step <ID>`.
3. **Safety**

   * Ignore all other planned steps unless re‑authorised.
   * If uncertainty arises, switch back to Ask Mode.
4. **Coding Standards**

   * Python ≥ 3.10, type‑annotated, PEP‑8.
   * CUDA kernels in `.cu`, exposed via pybind11.
   * Centralised config for model size, batch size, κ.

## Commit Protocol

* Commit one logical change per step.
* Include benchmark or test artifacts relevant to the step.
